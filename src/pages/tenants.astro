      { question: "What documents do I need to apply for a rental?", answer: "You'll typically need photo ID (passport or driving licence), proof of income (payslips or employment contract), bank statements, and references from previous landlords if applicable." },
      { question: "How much deposit is required?", answer: "Most properties require a deposit equivalent to 5 weeks' rent (capped by law). This is protected in a government-approved tenancy deposit scheme throughout your tenancy." },
      { question: "How do I report maintenance issues?", answer: "You can report maintenance issues through our online portal, by phone, or email. Emergency issues are handled 24/7, while non-urgent repairs are typically addressed within 48 hours." },
      { question: "Can I end my tenancy early?", answer: "Early termination depends on your tenancy agreement terms. Contact us to discuss your options – we may be able to help find a replacement tenant or negotiate with your landlord." }
